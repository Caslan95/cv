        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p class="personal-description">I am a graduate and have worked as a student assistant at the Institute of Polymer Technology in Erlangen for 2 years and had the chance to support the scientific assistant by various projects and to supervise guest
          students.
          During my stay in Melbourne, I did participate in the student project group "Precious Plastic" since I am keen on combining sustainable entrepreneurship with resource constrained innovation.
          Back in Germany, I was a member of the formula student group "High-Octane Motorsport e.V.". I have designed and manufactured the cockpit of the race car.
          Additionally, I am member of many local social organisations in Nuremberg and I am currently learning web development.</p>
